Welcome to my personal site! I’m Zikai (Kerry) Liu, a Master of Engineering student in Industrial Engineering and Operational Research at UC Berkeley, with a Mathematics undergraduate degree from the University of St Andrews. My professional interests lie at the intersection of data science and Generative AI, particularly in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RAG) for business insights and decision-making.

### Professional Background
I’ve gained valuable experience through internships in both the tech and corporate sectors, including data science roles at Amazon and VIP.com. My projects have focused on customer demand forecasting, logistics optimization, and model development to enhance supply chain efficiency. I’ve also explored various analytical tools and methodologies, from PyTorch for deep learning models to Python and SQL for data processing and automation.

### Research and Interests
My research spans health impact forecasting using Gaussian Process models and practical applications of NLP. I’m currently exploring time series forecasting and Transformer models for e-commerce, with a strong interest in entrepreneurship—particularly in tech-driven solutions like safety and logistics optimization.

### Hobbies and Blog
Outside of work, I’m an avid tennis player and traveler. I also write blog posts on data science topics, sharing insights from my academic and professional experiences.

Thank you for visiting! I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals in the fields of data science, AI, and innovation.
