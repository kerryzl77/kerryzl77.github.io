### Executive Summary
Airbnb's revenue strategy hinges on listing the most appealing properties at the top to maximize bookings. This project tackles the optimization of listing selection and pricing using a three-stage approach: 

1. **Demand Prediction** using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) through linear regression.
2. **Choice Modeling** leveraging a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model to account for utility and price sensitivity.
3. **Revenue Maximization** through Linear Programming to select optimal listings and prices.

The outcome? A tailored list of properties, their prices, and projected revenues.

### Background and Rationale
Airbnb revolutionizes the rental market by connecting hosts and renters worldwide. However, factors like seasonality, market competition, and property features make pricing and listing decisions challenging.

Standardizing demand and supply metrics allows for clearer comparisons and competitive pricing strategies. Past approaches like linear regression and random forests have laid the foundation for demand prediction. This study builds on these methods, integrating advanced modeling techniques to optimize revenue generation while ensuring utility for both guests and hosts.

### Data Collection
We utilized Airbnb listing data from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), focusing on Albany, NY. Key data features included:

- Host response rate
- Superhost status
- Identity verification
- Review scores
- Property price

Assumptions:
- Base price per person per night: $50.
- Seasonal price fluctuations modeled via a minimum price ratio.

### Methodology

#### **Demand Prediction (MLE)**
Demand is estimated using MLE via linear regression:

```math
Y_i = \beta_1 \cdot R_i + \beta_2 \cdot S_i + \beta_3 \cdot I_i + \beta_4 \cdot Q_i + \beta_5 \cdot P_i + \epsilon_{i}
\]

Where:
- \( Y_i \): Demand proxy (number of reviews).
- \( R_i, S_i, I_i, Q_i, P_i \): Listing features (e.g., response rate, superhost status).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_5 \): Coefficients.

#### **Pricing and Utility**
Price points for each property are calculated as:

\[
P_{i,j} = \text{Floor}_i + j \cdot \frac{\text{Ceiling}_i - \text{Floor}_i}{s - 1}
\]

Utility adjustments incorporate price sensitivity:

\[
U_{i,j} = U_i + \beta_5 \cdot P_{i,j}
\]

#### **Multinomial Logit (MNL) Choice Probability**
The choice probability for property \( i \) at price \( j \) is:

\[
\phi_{i,j} = \frac{e^{U_{i,j}}}{\sum e^{U_{k,l}}}
\]

This ensures probabilities are normalized across all properties in the same room-size category.

#### **Optimization**
The objective function maximizes expected revenue:

\[
\text{Maximize: } \sum_{\text{size}} \alpha_{\text{size}} \cdot \sum_{i \in \text{Size}(\text{size})} \sum_{j=0}^{s-1} x_i \cdot y_{i,j} \cdot (P_{i,j} \cdot \phi_{i,j} \cdot D)
\]

Subject to constraints:
- **Room size limits**: Max properties per room size.
- **Price selection**: Only one price per property.

### Results and Discussions
Our model optimized Airbnb listings and prices to achieve a total revenue of $21,492 under a demand scenario of 100 bookings. The selected average prices were:
- Small properties: $138.00.
- Medium properties: $208.00.
- Large properties: $417.60.

While effective, limitations include:
- Using review counts as a demand proxy may introduce bias.
- Fixed denominator assumptions in the MNL model oversimplify substitution effects.
- Ignoring outside options fails to capture customers who opt out entirely.

### Future Directions
Enhancements to consider:
- Incorporating detailed booking data.
- Accounting for outside options.
- Modeling customer heterogeneity in price sensitivity.

---

### Conclusion
This study highlights how integrating demand normalization and advanced modeling techniques can enhance pricing strategies for platforms like Airbnb. By addressing limitations and improving data quality, the approach offers significant potential for revenue optimization in the sharing economy.
