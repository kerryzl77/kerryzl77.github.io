## Executive Summary

Pricing decisions on platforms like Airbnb greatly influence both hosts' revenue and guests' satisfaction. In this post, we present an end-to-end approach for **revenue optimization** of Airbnb listings using a **Multinomial Logit (MNL)** choice model, combined with **demand estimation** via maximum likelihood (i.e., linear regression). With these methods, we solve a **mixed-integer optimization** problem to determine which properties to list and at what price. Our example leverages a dataset of 400+ Airbnb listings in Albany, NY, offering step-by-step insights on how to **estimate demand**, **model guest choices**, and **optimize** for maximum revenue.

## Background and Rationale

Airbnb’s success relies on matching guests to properties that fit their price and amenity preferences. Hosts, meanwhile, want to set prices that maximize bookings without leaving money on the table. Traditional single-property pricing models often neglect the competition among multiple listings: guests compare several properties before booking. This post demonstrates how **demand modeling** and **multinomial choice analysis** can be combined to optimize both selection and pricing decisions for a portfolio of Airbnb listings.

## Data Collection

We obtained publicly available data from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) for listings in Albany, NY. Key fields in the dataset include:

- **Host response rate**  
- **Superhost status**  
- **Identity verification**  
- **Review scores**  
- **Accommodates (room size)**  
- **Price**  

Each row represents an Airbnb listing with these attributes. We assume a baseline willingness-to-pay (WTP) of \$50 per person per night and adjust potential prices for each property around that baseline.  

## Methodology

### 1. Demand Prediction (MLE via Linear Regression)

We use **linear regression** to estimate the impact of features on demand, measured by the *number of reviews* as a proxy. For each listing \( i \):

\[
\text{reviews}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{response rate})_i 
                   + \beta_2 (\text{is superhost})_i
                   + \beta_3 (\text{identity verified})_i
                   + \beta_4 (\text{review score})_i
                   + \beta_5 (\text{price})_i + \epsilon_i
\]

<br/><img src='/images/LinearRegression.png'>

- The model returns coefficients \(\beta\) that quantify how each feature affects the likelihood of receiving bookings/reviews.  
- We standardize or normalize features as needed to improve training stability.

### 2. Pricing and Utility

After estimating \(\beta\)-coefficients, we derive a **base utility** \(U_i\) for each property \(i\), reflecting non-price factors:

\[
U_i = \beta_1 \cdot \text{resp rate}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{is superhost}_i + \dots
\]

We then model price as an additional **negative** utility component:

\[
U_{i,j} = U_i + \beta_{\text{price}} \cdot P_{i,j}
\]

where \(P_{i,j}\) is the \(j\)-th price candidate for property \(i\).

### 3. Multinomial Logit (MNL) Choice Probability

We divide listings by **room size** (small, medium, large) and assume customers choose among the properties within their preferred room size. For each size category:

\[
\phi_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(U_{i,j})}{\sum_{k}\exp(U_{k,j})}
\]

- \(\phi_{i,j}\) is the probability that a customer of that room-size segment picks property \(i\) at price index \(j\).

### 4. Optimization Model

We formulate a **mixed-integer linear program** to decide:
1. **Which properties to include** (binary variable \(x_i\)).
2. **Which price to set** from discrete options (binary variables \(y_{i,j}\)).

The objective maximizes **expected revenue**:

\[
\max \quad \sum_{\text{size}} \Bigl[\alpha_{\text{size}} \times \Bigl(\sum_{i} \sum_{j} x_i \cdot y_{i,j} \cdot P_{i,j} \cdot \phi_{i,j} \cdot \text{TotalDemand}\Bigr)\Bigr]
\]

**Constraints**:
- **Room size limit**: e.g., \(\sum_{i \in \text{size}} x_i \leq \text{MaxProps}_{\text{size}}\).
- **Price selection**: \(\sum_{j} y_{i,j} = x_i\) (if a property is chosen, exactly one price must be selected).

A commercial solver (e.g., Gurobi) or open-source libraries can solve this efficiently for typical data sizes.

## Results and Discussion

- **Optimal Subset**: The solver picks the top-performing properties within each room size, respecting constraints (e.g., max 50 small, 30 medium, 20 large).  
- **Recommended Prices**:  
  - Small properties: Averaged around \$130--\$140.  
  - Medium properties: Around \$200.  
  - Large properties: Over \$400 on average.  

This yields a **projected revenue** of \$21,492 under our assumption of 100 total bookings distributed across the categories.

**Key Observations**:
- Listings with high baseline utility (e.g., high review scores, superhost status) get slightly higher optimal prices without severely hurting conversion probabilities.  
- Strict capacity limits on each size category can push smaller properties’ prices up if demand is strong.  

### Model Caveats

1. **Review counts** are only a rough proxy for demand. Actual bookings data would be ideal.  
2. **MNL assumption** can underestimate how some travelers might also consider different room sizes.  
3. We don’t explicitly model an *outside option* (i.e., guests choosing a different platform or not booking at all).  

Still, this integrated approach provides a strong baseline for data-driven pricing decisions.

## Future Directions

- **Refine Demand Proxy**: Use actual bookings if available rather than review counts.  
- **Heterogeneous Preferences**: Account for travelers who might choose either a small or medium listing.  
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Extend the model to incorporate seasonality and real-time updates.  
- **Outside Options**: Incorporate “no-booking” or competitor listings to more accurately capture real-world behavior.  

## Conclusion

By coupling **linear regression** for demand estimation and an **MNL-based** optimization framework, hosts and platforms can systematically **select which properties to list** and **set optimal prices** to maximize overall revenue. While the model has simplifying assumptions, it illustrates the power of combining machine learning with optimization in real-world pricing scenarios.
